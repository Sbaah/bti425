### routing-scenarios

This code example was based on the *brand new* Angular App Template version 1. You can find that project in the [Templates and solutions](../Templates_and_solutions) folder. It includes Bootstrap 3, the routing feature, a nav menu, and some getting-started components.

This app shows the popular routing scenarios. We added an in-memory data service, routing with parameters, and components that do some data service operations (get and add).
