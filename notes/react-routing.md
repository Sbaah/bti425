## "Routing" in React

One of the key components in creating a SPA (Single Page Application) is *routing*.

Routing enables navigation among components. It *replaces* a browser's built-in or default "navigator" management (i.e. management of the URL/address bar), with its own functionality.

When the URL is changed, the desired component(s) are activated and displayed in the view. 

While it is possible to create a router in (JavaScript) code, many developers use a widely-used library, [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/):

> Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate ... React Router works ...

<br>

### Getting Started using React Router

Add the React Router package to the app:

```
npm install react-router-dom --save
```

Now, assume that we have three top-level components that represent three separate views, ie: **Home**, **Projects** and **Project**:

```jsx
class Home extends Component{
  render(){
    return <h1>Home Page</h1>
  }
}

class Projects extends Component{
  render(){
    return <h1>All Projects Page</h1>
  }
}

class Project extends Component{
  render(){
    return <h1>Specific Project Page</h1>
  }
}
```

Note that each of these components (views) currently only renders an `<h1>` element, however in a real application they would be defined in separate files and contain many child components.

If we wish to conditionally render each of the above components (views) based on the following routes:

* "/" renders &lt;Home /&gt;
* "/projects" renders &lt;Projects /&gt;
* "/project" renders &lt;Project /&gt;

We will modify our App.js file as well as our index.js file.

<br>

### index.js changes

Do the following: 

* "import" the `BrowserRouter` component:  
`import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'` 

* Update the `ReactDOM.render()` method to wrap the `<App />` component in a `<BrowserRouter>` component:

  ```jsx
  ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter foo="bar">
        <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
    , document.getElementById('root'));
  ```

<br>

### App.js changes

Import the `<Route>` and `<Switch>` components:  
`import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'`

Update the render() method of the "App" class to use the following JSX:

```jsx
return(
  <Switch>
    <Route exact path='/' render={() => (<Home />)} />
    <Route exact path='/Projects' render={() => (<Projects />)} />
    <Route exact path='/Project' render={() => (<Project />)} />
  </Switch>
  );
```

Here, we can define our routes explicitly using the ["Switch" component](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch) with our three nested ["Route" components](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route).  Each of the routes have a "path" property which we use to define the target route, as well as a "render" property which defines which component will be rendered for that route.  

In all three above routes, we use the ["exact"](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/exact-bool) because we want to match the route *exactly* (ie, we don't care about "/Project/1" yet, only "/Project") 

<br>

### Adding URL Parameters to our Routes

If we wish to pass a specific URL pattern to a given route, we can use the same syntax as we're accustomed to in Node.js, ie: "/routeName/:parameter". To pass the ":parameter" to the `<Project />` component (so we can make use of routes like "/project/4", etc), we need to make the following changes to our files: 

* Update the "Project" component's "render()" method to include a reference to an "id" property:

  ```jsx
  render(){
    return <h1>Project {this.props.id} Page</h1>
  }
  ```

* Update the "Project" `<Route>` component:

  ```jsx
  <Route path='/Project/:id' render={(props) => (
      <Project id={props.match.params.id} />
  )}/>
  ```
  
Once we have made the above changes (removed "exact", added /:id, referenced props.match.params.id, etc.), we can now render routes that look like "/Project/9" or "/Project/abc" and see the results reflected in the browser.

<br>

### Adding A "Not Found" Route

Using React Router, we can easily define a "Not Found" route; this is analagous to the "404" error that we returned from server calls when a route was not matched.

To add a "Not Found" route, we simply need to add another route as a child to our `<Switch>` component defined in App.js.  This route will need to be **beneath** the other routes, so that it doesn't block any of our legitimate routes:

```jsx
<Route render={() => (
    <h1>Not Found</h1>
)}/>
```

<br>

### Linking to a Route

To use the react router effectively, we cannot simply use normal links to route to our pages from within the application. For example, using code like this...

```html
<a href="/myRoute">My Route</a>
```
...would lead to a whole page reload (we only want to load the full app at the beginning, not after every route change).  Instead, what we need to do is use the `<Link>` component (from "react-router-dom"), to prevent this from happening.  

The same code can updated to use the `<Link>` component as follows:

```html
<Link to='/myRoute'>My Route</Link>
```

<br>

### "Redirecting" to a Route

Sometimes, we wish to "redirect" the user to a different route and override the current route in the "history" stack (or alternatively "push" it onto the current history stack) - this is similar to what we would use [res.redirect()](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.redirect) for in our Node.js servers.

React provides an intuitive way to achieve this, by providing a special [&lt;Redirect /&gt;](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect) component.  When rendered, it will redirect the client to the specified route using the following syntax (Note: the use of "push" will add the new route to the "history" stack):

```jsx
<Redirect push to={"/newRoute"} />
```
