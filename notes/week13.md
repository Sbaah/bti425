### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, April 14*

Test 3 is on Tuesday, April 14, 2020, and approximately 70 to 80 minutes have been alotted for the test. 

<mark>You <em>MUST</em> write the test <em>during</em> your normally-scheduled class time:</mark>
* Section NAA - 8:00am to 9:45am 
* Section NBB - 11:40am to 1:25pm 
* Section NCC - 1:30pm to 3:15pm 

#### Test format 

The test will be delivered as an editable Microsoft Word document, from a Blackboard "Assignments" link, for your specific section (NAA, NBB, or NCC). The document will have questions, and open space for you to use to type in your answer. Each question-and-answer will be worth two marks, and therefore you will write answers for any ten (10) questions. 

When writing the test, we have the same expectations as we do in class:
1. There will be some choice in answering questions 
1. No resources permitted 
1. Do your own work 
1. Practice academic honesty

We suggest that you *save* the document after writing your answer to each question. 

#### Completing and submitting your work

At the end of the timeslot, make sure that you submit to the same link on Blackboard. Remember that Blackboard will run your work through the SafeAssign tool, checking your answers against those from other students, and comparing your answers with web and other published content. 

#### What's on the test

You can expect test questions about topics covered since the last test, all the way to current topics. Obviously, you must review the topics yourself, but in general, you can expect questions about:
* Angular topics - all of them from week 6 onwards
* Yes, including the security topics 

[This document](test-success-info) has more information about the test.

#### Practice academic honesty

There are three sections of the BTI425 course. All sections have Test 3 on the same day. The test will be different for each section. You are *EXPECTED* to behave with academic integrity - *DO NOT* communicate, in any way, with another BTI425 student about the content of the test.

#### Getting help while you prepare for the test

Your professor will plan to have good availablity during the week. Information about how this works is documented here:
